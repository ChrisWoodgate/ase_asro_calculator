# ase\_asro\_calculator

## Citation

There is no publication associated with these (very lightweight) scripts. However, if they were useful for your research, you may wish to consider citing my paper, [Phys. Rev. Mater **7**, 103801 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.7.013801), where a definition of the Warren-Cowley parameters in the multicomponent setting is given (Eq. 12), along with appropriate citations to the original literature where they were first defined.
